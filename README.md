# Emoji Converter

This is a simple web app that allows you to convert text containing emoji codes (e.g. `:smile:`) to their corresponding emojis.




## Usage

```
1) Clone or download the repository.
2) Open index.html in your web browser.
3) Enter the text you want to convert in the input box.
4) Click the "Convert" button to see the converted text.

```
## Note

If you need to add new emojis to the conversion, you can update the `emojiMap.js` file by adding the new emoji code and its corresponding Unicode character. You can find the Unicode character for an emoji on the [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) website. After updating the `emojiMap.js` file, save the changes and refresh the page in your web browser to see the new emoji codes added to the conversion.
